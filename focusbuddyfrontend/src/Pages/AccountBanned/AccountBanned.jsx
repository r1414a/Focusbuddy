            We regret to inform you that your account has been canceled as your
            attendance score has dropped to 0%. As mentioned in our policy,
            maintaining regular attendance is crucial for both your progress and
            the integrity of our community. Unfortunately, reaching a 0%
            attendance score has resulted in the permanent closure of your
            account.
