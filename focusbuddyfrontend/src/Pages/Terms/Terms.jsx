        The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides
        recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the
        Internet infringes their rights under the U.S. copyright law. If you
        believe in good faith that materials hosted by COMPANY infringe your
        copyright, you, or your agent may send to COMPANY a notice requesting
        that the material be removed or access to it be blocked. Any
        notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its
        behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be
        considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon
        COMPANY actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing
        material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice
        of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA
        permits you to send to COMPANY a counter-notice. All notices and counter
        notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the
        DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. COMPANY’s Copyright
        Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement or counter notices
        can be reached as follows: hi@focusbuddy.com. This Agreement shall be
        binding upon and inure to the benefit of COMPANY and our respective
        assigns, successors, heirs, and legal representatives. Neither this
        Agreement nor any rights hereunder may be assigned without the prior
        written consent of COMPANY. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights
        and obligations under this Agreement may be freely assigned by COMPANY
        to any affiliated entity or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries. These
        Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
        laws of the State of Delaware and any dispute shall be subject to
        binding arbitration in Delaware. If any provision of this agreement
        shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that
        provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not
        affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
